# Inventory-Update
Compares and updates the inventory stored in a 2D array against a second 2D array of a fresh delivery. Updates the current existing inventory item quantities (in `arr1`). If the values are different then add the new inventory to the current, otherwise keep the same. If an item cannot be found, adds the new item and quantity into the inventory array. The returned inventory array will be in alphabetical order by item.
